### Hey there! My name is Eve Liu.
Outside of class, there's a variety of things I enjoy doing, such as photography, vlogging, gaming, and going to concerts (I recently discovered that building LEGO models is also super fun after building a 53-inch long Titanic model over summer break). I view myself as a person who has great patience, empathy, and respect for others, and I *love* hearing different perspectives and learning from people better than me. "Forever Forward" is what I take as the life motto; It has carried me through many challenges in the past, and will continue to motivate me on the road to becoming a stronger person.
