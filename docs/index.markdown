# **Computer Systems**
These are some of the more challenging projects I did in CMU's Introduction to Computer Systems[^1] course, all of which built up my understanding of essential concepts used in computer systems.

## Malloc Lab
A dynamic memory allocator that efficiently reproduces the `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`, and `calloc` library functions. My task in this lab was to write these function from scratch to satisfy some performance benchmarks, which required a relatively good grasp of the low-level memory layout. 

The starter code used a single implicit list to manage the data blocks, which is (insert weakness). I did () to boost performance to ().
## Shell Lab
//TODO
## Proxy Lab
A concurrent Web proxy that sits between local browsers and the rest of the World Wide Web.

# **3D Animation**
## Dreamwriter
[Showcase Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fceOg6SGZs)

A short 3D animation film in which I was responsible for everything in the pipeline from character design, storyboarding, 3D modeling, rigging, to animation. [[Read More]](projects/Dreamwriter.md)
