This is my final project for the course Understanding Game Engines at CMU. I had little knowledge about game engines before taking this course. I built up my skills by implementing components for different types of games each week, from simple ones like Pong to more involved ones like a 3D version of Astral Attack. Toward the end of the semester, we were learning to build a 2D platformer which is my favorite genre. I immediately decided to extend it to a full 4-level game for my final project.
